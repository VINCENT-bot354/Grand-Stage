I want to build a custom CMS-based website for my stage play group called **Grand Stage Productions**. The site will be deployed on **Render** and should follow this exact functionality and structure:

---

### üé≠ General Website Features:

- The site title is **Grand Stage Productions**.
- Below the title, display the slogan **"Bringing Stories to Life"**.
- Use a **deep maroon theatrical theme** ‚Äî the entire site should feel nostalgic, warm, and inspired by old stage plays.
  - Include vintage visuals such as illustrations or silhouettes of old cameras or spotlights.
  - Avoid using actual camera photos ‚Äî go for images or backgrounds that *feel* like a stage production.
  - Suggest CSS or styling techniques that support a dramatic, retro stage look.
- Add SEO metadata (`meta title`, `meta description`, and Open Graph tags) to all pages.
  - Example meta description: ‚ÄúGrand Stage Productions ‚Äì Bringing Stories to Life through theatre, creativity, and storytelling.‚Äù

### üñºÔ∏è Website Layout:

#### ‚úÖ Base Template Layout:
- **Top Section** (horizontal layout):
  - **Logo on the far left**.
  - Immediately to the right of the logo, display the **site title** (Grand Stage Productions).
  - After the title, include the **navigation menu** (Home, About, Gallery, Contact).
- **Slogan** appears clearly below the top section.
- **Bottom Section**:
  - Editable contact details (email, phone, etc.)
  - Clickable social icons for **Instagram, Facebook, Twitter (X), WhatsApp**
    - Each icon should link to URLs stored in the database.
    - These links should be editable from the admin panel.

### üõ†Ô∏è Admin Panel (Custom CMS):

- A secure admin panel should allow the admin to:
  - Upload or update the **logo**
  - **Add/edit/delete**:
    - **Text content** for any page (Home, About, Contact, etc.)
    - **Embedded video links** (from YouTube or Instagram) viewable directly on the site (not redirecting)
    - **Photo links** (not uploads)
      - Every image should display a **short description directly below it**
    - **Social media links**, **WhatsApp link**, and **contact information**
- All content should be **fully dynamic** (loaded from the database ‚Äî no hardcoded HTML).

---

### üóÑÔ∏è Backend & Database:

- Use **Flask** as the web framework.
- Use **PostgreSQL** as the database (compatible with **Render** hosting).
- Use **SQLAlchemy** as the ORM.
- Admin login should be secure (with authentication).
- The site must be fully **deployable on Render**.

---

### üì¶ requirements.txt:

- Create a `requirements.txt` file containing **only the actual dependencies used** in the project (avoid unused ones).
- You can use tools like `pipreqs` to automatically detect and list used libraries only.
